Mumbai Apartment Price Prediction Model Description This project provides a machine learning model to predict the price of apartments in Mumbai based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), and available amenities like swimming pool, landscaped gardens, clubhouse, car parking, and lift availability. The model is built using Python and the Dash library for creating an interactive web application.

I am using 3 year previous data to train and  predict the apartment prices. Doing some research i find that the apartment price are inflated at the rate of 10.2% each year and for previous 3 years it's about 42% so, i tweak the intercept of the ridge model in such a way it would give better predictions by ajusting the current inflation. 

it's  accuray is around 90% according to the current market rate.


You can run this project online, I am using render to host this webpage the link is given below:
