Mumbai Apartment Price Prediction Model Description This project provides a machine learning model to predict the price of apartments in Mumbai based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), and available amenities like swimming pool, landscaped gardens, clubhouse, car parking, and lift availability. The model is built using Python and the Dash library for creating an interactive web application.

I am using 3 year previous data to train and  predict the apartment prices so, i tweek the intercept of the ridge model to give better predictions.
it's  around 90 percent accurate prediction according to the market rate.
